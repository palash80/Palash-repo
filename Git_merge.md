## Introduction


In version control systems, merging branches is essential for combining separate lines of development. It enables collaboration by integrating changes from one branch into another, facilitating the incorporation of new features or fixes. This process ensures that multiple developers can work independently without disrupting the main codebase. By merging branches, developers can consolidate their work into a unified codebase, promoting seamless collaboration and code integration.


---

## Purpose

The purpose of merging branches in version control systems (VCS) is to integrate changes made in separate branches back into the main codebase or designated integration branch. This process allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

## Why merging is important ?

| **Purpose**                                            | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Experimentation and Exploration**                   | Data scientists often need to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing techniques. By creating separate branches for each experiment, they can easily compare and track the results of different approaches. |
| **Collaboration and Teamwork**                        | Large ML projects often involve multiple data scientists and developers working on different parts of the codebase. Branching allows each team member to work on their own tasks or features without interfering with each other's work. |
| **Release Management**                                | When a new version of a model is ready for deployment, it may need to be tested and validated before being merged into the main codebase. By creating a release branch, developers can ensure that only tested and validated code is included in the final release. |
| **Risk Management and Disaster Recovery**             | In the event of a major bug or issue in the codebase, it may be necessary to roll back to a previous version. By creating backups and separate branches, developers can quickly revert to a previous state without losing data or progress. |

## Why Git 


| **Key Reasons to Choose Git over Other VCS**          | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distributed Version Control**                       | Git is a distributed version control system, allowing every developer to have a complete copy of the repository with its full history. This enables offline work and faster operations. |
| **Branching and Merging**                             | Git provides powerful branching and merging capabilities, allowing developers to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Merging branches is also straightforward. |
| **Speed and Performance**                             | Git is known for its speed and performance, making operations like committing changes, branching, and merging efficient even for large projects. |
| **Open Source and Community Support**                  | Git is an open-source project maintained by a large community of developers, ensuring plenty of resources, documentation, and community support for users. |
| **Flexibility and Customizability**                   | Git offers flexibility and customizability, allowing developers to tailor their workflows, configurations, and integrations to suit their specific needs. |

## Working flow

- In our case, we have two branches one is the default branch called “main” and the other branch named “dev” and this is how our git repo looks before merging. Here git finds the common base, creates a new merge commit, and merged them.

## Advantages


1. Merge is simple, straightforward, and familiar
2. Merge preserves the entire history in chronological order
3. Merge maintains the branch’s context
4. Merge creates a complete log that helps developers understand the big picture, showing when and how each merge occurred
5. Merge makes it easy for users to find mistakes and correct them

- When we perform merging, git always merges with the current branch from where we are performing the operation(in our case it is “main”). By this, the branch being merged is not affected.
