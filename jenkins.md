## Introduction

**What is Jenkins ?**

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation tool for building, testing, and deploying software. It has become the go-to tool for DevOps teams to automate their software development pipelines. Jenkins is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that helps automate the build, test, and deployment processes of software applications. This article will introduce you to Jenkins, its architecture and components, benefits, use cases.

**Why we used Jenkins for?**

| **Content**                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|:-------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deploying code into production** | Taking developed and tested code and making it available for use by customers or end-users. It involves transferring code from development or testing environments to the live environment. |
| **Enabling task automation**     | Using technology to automate repetitive tasks without human intervention, similar to setting up a robot to handle chores.                                                               |
| **Driving continuous integration** | Regularly merging code changes from different developers into a shared version, akin to mixing ingredients to ensure they work well together in a recipe.                            |
| **Enhancing coding efficiency**   | Finding methods to write code faster and better, similar to learning shortcuts or using tools for quicker and more accurate coding.                                                   |
| **Increasing code coverage**     | Writing tests to check more parts of the code for errors or bugs, ensuring comprehensive testing similar to inspecting more areas of a house to ensure everything works properly.  |

## Prerequisites

### Java

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Jenkins is a Java-based application, so you need to have Java installed on your system. Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or later.

## Architecture


- **Master-Slave Architecture**

- In the diagram, the following items are taken care of:

Jenkins will check the GIT repository for any changes in the source code at regular intervals
Each Jenkins build requires its own testing environment, which canâ€™t be created on a single server. Jenkins accomplishes this by employing various slaves as needed
Jenkins Master will communicate the re
